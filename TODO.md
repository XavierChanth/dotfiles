# TODO

This is the most important file in this repo. In order to maintain productivity
and prevent the urge and downward spiral of always making things perfect: just
add a todo list right into the repo.

## TODOs

- finish setting up neomutt
- create install-de.sh file for setting up desktop environments 
  - everything: install wezterm, aerc + account config file (manually)
  - macos: aerospace, raycast, sketchybar
  - fedora: whatever I decided to use the next time I configure it :)
