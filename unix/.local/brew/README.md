# Brew

This folder tracks all of the brew related files.

- `Brewfile` is the list of all the brew packages that I have installed.
- `user-leaves.txt` is the list of all explicitly installed brew packages.
- `user-leaves.macos.txt` is the list of all explicitly installed brew packages for macOS, generally to patch macOS to feel like linux.
